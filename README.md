# Neural-Network-Project
Study networks of interconnected computation units that enable highly-parallel computation, non-linear function approximation, etc.

###### Perception Training Algorithm
- Building and training neural network, using the multicategory PTA for digit classification on MNIST.  
###### Curve Fitting
- Use the backpropagation algorithm with online learning for curve fitting, finding the optimal weights/network that minimize the mean-squared error.  
###### Image Classification
- Design and implement a convolutional network that takes images and map them to 9 shape classes.  
###### Autoencoder and Clustering
- Build and train a denoising autoencoder for unsupervised learning. Obtain all outputs and cluster them using the k-means algorithm, then reassign indices such that the accuracy is maximized, since k-means is agnostic to labels.  
###### Text Generation LSTM
- Implement a character-level text generation LSTM to generate person names.
